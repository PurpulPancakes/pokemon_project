        <p>Squirtle, known as the Tiny Turtle Pokémon, are turtle Pokémon with large eyes and chubby cheeks,
        capable of moving either on two feet or on all fours. Their skin is a light blue, and they possess
        a long, curled tail. When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraw their limbs into their brown-orange
        shells and spray water from their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or merely
        to intimidate it.If attacked anyway, their shells are resilient, and provide excellent protection.
        It shelters itself in its shell, then strikes back with spouts of water at every opportunity.
        Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on
        its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
        The idea to feature Squirtle and the other Red and Blue starters in a significant role in
        Pokemon X and Y came about a year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega
        Evolutions for the three Pokémon's final forms were created, and the designers decided that
        they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these Pokémon in order to see their
        Mega Evolved form.</p>
