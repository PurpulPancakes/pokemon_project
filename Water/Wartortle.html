        <p>Wartortle are small, bipedal, turtle-like Pok√©mon with a similar appearance to
         that of their pre-evolved form, Squirtle. Some differences are that Wartortle have
         developed sharper and larger claws and teeth. Their tails are larger and fluffier
         than Squirtle's. The fur on Wartortle's tail darkens with age. Wartortle have 
         developed large furry ears. Like its pre-evolved form, it can also use its shell to protect
         itself. Its shell bears the scratches of many battles.</p>
