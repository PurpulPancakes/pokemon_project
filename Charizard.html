            <p>
                Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside 
                from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly 
                raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its 
                rectangular head. There are two fangs visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is 
                closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and 
                a horn-like appendage juts out from the third joint of each wing. A single 
                wing-finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's 
                arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three 
                white claws. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade 
                feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame.
            </p>
            <p>

                Charizard has two Mega Forms. Both feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit 
                pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw.
            </p>
                As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms 
                remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes 
                with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips 
                of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are 
                larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each 
                horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, 
                and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each 
                wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out 
                the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue. It is said that its 
                new power turns it black and creates more intense flames.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. 
                It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. 
                Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso 
                is thinner and longer. It features longer digitigrade feet. Its hands are less developed, 
                with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated each from the others. 
                Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the 
                wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. 
                The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, 
                which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying 
                prowess that is greater than a jet fighter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Charmeleon has a vicious nature and will constantly seek out opponents. 
                Strong opponents excite this Pokémon, causing it to spout bluish-white flames that 
                torch its surroundings. However, it will relax once it has won. It is rare in the 
                wild, but it can be found in mountainous areas.
