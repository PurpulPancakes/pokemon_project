        <p>Blastoise are large, tortoise-like Pok√©mon with some features similar to those of
         its pre-evolved forms. Blastoise has a large blue body, cream-colored stomach, small
         fat arms and legs, and a large brown shell rimmed with white, featuring its water
         cannons. It is now noticeably bulkier than its previous evolutions. Like its pre-evolved
         forms, Blastoise has a shell which covers its entire body, which it can also be withdrawn
         into. Contrary to Squirtle and Wartortle, Blastoise has large, water cannons that are
         located on the top left and right sides. The water that comes out of the cannons is capable
         of punching holes through thick steel.</p>
