                Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange body and blue eyes. 
                Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. 
                It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. 
                A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail and has blazed there since 
                Charmander's birth. The flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood, 
                burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when 
                it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander dies if its flame 
                goes out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if 
                it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain.<br/>
                Charmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas. However, it is found far more 
                often in the ownership of Trainers. As shown in Pokémon Snap, Charmander 
                exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food.
